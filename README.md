# Paper Mario KMod

This hack is based on the [papermario-dx decompilation](https://github.com/bates64/papermario-dx) fork, which provides a flexible, easy-to-use base for creating romhacks.

## List of changes

- Increased max level to 130, HP/FP limit to 250, and BP limit to 99
- You will always gain at least 1 SP from an enemy even if there is a level gap
- Increased the time that it takes for dropped items to expire
- Swapped the max amounts of key items and held items you can carry (now 10 and 32 respectively)
